## Project Title & Introduction               

### Data Analysis of United Nations (UN) International migrant stock 2019. 

The dataset can be found here.<nav><a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates19.asp"> International migrant stock 2019 </a>   

The dataset presents estimates of international migrant by age, sex and origin. Estimates are presented for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019 and are available for all countries and areas of the world. The estimates are based on official statistics on the foreign-born or the foreign population.

## Project Motivation                                
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)   
  
A lot of people migrate every year from one place to other for better living conditions, to find better working places with humane conditions for employees, and to raise their children in a better socio-economic environment. The reasons could vary from personal, professional advancement to just exploring new places, cultures, languages and people. Lately, I also have been thinking about moving back to Europe from where I completed my MS in Astrophysics or probably north American side of the world.     
  
Therefore, I wanted to see if any data is available on immigration and what better data could be there than UN Immigration data. The dataset available was the most recent one at the time of analysis.

## Project Objectives                                
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)           
 
The goals of the project were to find insights about the following topics:        
  * Trend of Immigration to and from Germany. 
  * The countries which contributed the most and the least towards immigration to Germany. 
  * Syrian civil war effect on Germany. Germany was in the news for opening its borders for immigrants from Syria.
  * People from developing countries move to developed countries all the time, but did people from developed countries also move to somewhere else? 
  * Where did Pakistanis move to? What's the trend from Pakistan to Germany in comparison to India and China? 
  * Afghan war effect on Pakistan. Pakistan was accepting a lot of immigrants from Afghanistan due to war conditions there. 

These were a few of the exciting questions i wanted to find answers to; ***answers proven by data.***
